\title{Get Compiled Stan Model}
\usage{
get_stan_model(backend = NULL, recompile = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{backend}{Character string specifying which backend to use: "cmdstanr"
(default) or "rstan". If NULL, will try cmdstanr first, then rstan.}

\item{recompile}{Logical; if TRUE, force recompilation even if model is cached}
}
\value{
Compiled Stan model object (class depends on backend)
}
\description{
Returns a compiled Stan model object. Compiles the model on first call
and caches it for subsequent calls. Supports both rstan and cmdstanr backends.
}
\details{
The function attempts to use cmdstanr by default as it typically provides
better performance and more features. If cmdstanr is not available, it falls
back to rstan.

The compiled model is cached in the package environment to avoid
recompilation on subsequent calls.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get model using default backend (cmdstanr)
model <- get_stan_model()

# Force use of rstan
model <- get_stan_model(backend = "rstan")

# Force recompilation
model <- get_stan_model(recompile = TRUE)
}
