\title{Predict Method for IRT Model Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{irt_fit}(object, type = c("abilities", "person_scores"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "irt_fit"}

\item{type}{Type of prediction to return:
\describe{
\item{"abilities"}{Full ability scores (theta = beta0 + X*b + zeta)}
\item{"person_scores"}{Same as "abilities" (alias)}
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Matrix of predictions (N x K)
}
\description{
Extract ability estimates and other predictions from fitted IRT models
}
\details{
The "abilities" or "person_scores" type returns the complete ability
estimates including both the fixed effects (intercepts and covariate effects)
and the random effects (individual deviations).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
fit <- fit_ability(response_data, item_loadings,
                   threshold_left, threshold_right, method = "map")

# Get ability estimates
abilities <- predict(fit)
abilities <- predict(fit, type = "abilities")
}
